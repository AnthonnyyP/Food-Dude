### **_Description_**:

This will be a blog dedicated to all things food but most notably recipes!

This project will be utilizing the concepts of MVC framework to produce a full-stacked application, in this case, a blog, which allows the user to search and view recipes. They will be able to create a post for their favorite recipes but also comment on others' recipes as well. Users will also have the ability to add recipes that they would like to try to their "recipe book" or "cook book" to be referred to later on.

API functionality will be added as well to supply recipes!
